I'm currently a third year Phd student in the [Database Group](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~db/index.html) of the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/v1/), Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) supervised by [Prof. Jianliang Xu](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~xujl/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the School of Electronic Information and Communications [(EIC)](http://ei.hust.edu.cn/English/Home.htm), Huazhong University of Science and Technology [(HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn/) in 2020.

Research Interests
======
I am interested in graph data management, especially distributed and parallel graph computation. I also have interest in developing efficient algorithms for streaming graph computation. I am willing to cooperate with companies (e.g., Huawei, Tencent) and tackle issues in real industrial scenarios, please feel free to drop me an email if you are interested!

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
