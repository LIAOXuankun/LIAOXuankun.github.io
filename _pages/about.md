I'm currently a third year Phd student in the [Database Group](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~db/index.html) of the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/v1/), Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) supervised by [Prof. Jianliang Xu](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~xujl/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the School of Electronic Information and Communications [(EIC)](http://ei.hust.edu.cn/English/Home.htm), Huazhong University of Science and Technology [(HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn/) in 2020.

Research Interests
======
* Distributed/Parallel graph computation
* Building graph computation engine
* Algorithms for streaming graph computation

I am willing to cooperate with companies (e.g., Huawei, Tencent) and tackle issues in real industrial scenarios, please feel free to drop me an email if you are interested!
